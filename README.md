* Cats and dogs image classification: <https://colab.research.google.com/github/szywyk/Machine-learning-Python/blob/main/Cats-and-dogs-image-classification.ipynb>
* Bird classification with transfer learning EfficientNetV2-B0 97.9%: <https://www.kaggle.com/code/szymonio/efiicientnetv2-b0-bird-classification>
* Bird classification with transfer learning MobileNetV2 94.4%: <https://www.kaggle.com/code/szymonio/mobilenetv2-transfer-learning>
* Bird classification - no transfer learning - just image augmentation 65%: <https://www.kaggle.com/code/szymonio/birds-classification-augmented>

Model using transfer learning with EfficientNetV2 as base model was used in bird species recognition app available at: <https://szywyk.github.io/mybirdie-app/>
